## ðŸ§ª Example Redis Pub/Sub Flow

1. **User posts a trade** â†’ `TradeSpace` emits `trade:posted` event  
2. **Redis** publishes this event to all subscribers  
3. **Socket Service** receives it and pushes to all connected clients in real time  
4. **Analytics Microservice (future)** can listen and record stats asynchronously
